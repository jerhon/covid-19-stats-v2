A probable case is a person who has presentable symptoms WITH epidemiological evidence or has BOTH a positive presumptive laboratory test AND also EITHER presentable symptoms OR epidemiological evidence, or who has been issued a death certificate listing COVID-19 as a cause of death or significant contributing cause of death with no confirmatory testing. Epidemiological evidence refers either to close proximity contact with a known case or travel history to an area with high disease incidence. According to the guidelines, FDA approved antibody and antigen tests are considered presumptive laboratory evidence and therefore only one potential part of the evidence required to classify a case as probable."

Therefore, it should be contextualized as, at best, an estimate of national testing performance.\n\nIn most states, the totalTestResults field is currently computed by adding positive and negative values because, historically, some states do not report totals, and to work around different reporting cadences for cases and tests. In Colorado and Rhode Island, where reliable testing encounters figures are available with a complete time series, we directly report those figures in this field. We are in the process of switching all states over to use directly reported total figures, using a policy of preferring testing encounters, specimens, and people, in that order."
